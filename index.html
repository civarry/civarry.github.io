        <p>
          To become a full stack developer, you’ll need to familiarize yourself
          with two basic web development concepts: the front end and the back
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front end, also known as client-side or customer-facing side,
          refers to all the elements of a computer application that users
          interact with directly. By contrast, the back end encompasses all the
          behind-the-scenes tech that computes business logic, fulfills user
          requests, and permanently stores sensitive data.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can think of the front end as the tip of an iceberg, while the
          bulk of the unseen back end extends far below the water’s surface.

          Every learner’s path will be slightly different depending on their
          preexisting experience and skill set. If you’re a true beginner,
          you’ll require specialized training and project experience to become a
          developer. The same applies to hobbyists, who will need to upskill
          much more than professional developers who hope to upgrade their
          careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take stock of your skills! Here are a few basic capabilities that
          you’ll need to master if you want to thrive as a full stack developer:
        </p>
        <ul class="tab">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
          <li>SQL/NoSQL</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Timeline">
        <header>Timeline</header>
        <p>
          How soon do you want to go from hitting the books to landing your
          first entry-level developer position? As with your earlier skill
          assessment
        </p>
        <p>
          establishing a concrete timeline can help you choose your educational
          journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’ve already locked yourself into a full-time career or family
          commitments, it can be challenging to start a new training regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is by no means impossible. Think about the changes you’re
          willing to make to pursue your dreams — and build your educational
          schedule accordingly.

          In the era of open-source everything, it’s easier than ever to learn
          how to become a full stack developer — but it’s also easier to get
          lost in the muck. There’s a near-daunting number of distinct
          educational routes available to newcomers.
